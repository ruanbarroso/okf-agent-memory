# OKF Agent Memory — Release Playbook

This playbook defines the canonical, step-by-step procedure for releasing new versions of **OKF Agent Memory** (`okf`).

---

## 1. Release Architecture & CI/CD Flow

OKF Agent Memory releases follow GitFlow with strict, automated GitHub Actions CI/CD gates:

flowchart TD
    A[develop: Feature/Fix Commits] --> B[Prepare Release Artifacts]
    B --> C["docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md + Full Changelog"]
    B --> D["docs/releases/README.md Archive Table"]
    B --> E["knowledge/log.md + roadmap/milestones.md"]
    B --> F["CONTRIBUTORS.md Credit Community"]
    C & D & E & F --> S["Agent stages files + proposes commit message"]
    S --> G["Maintainer: signed commit & push to develop"]
    G --> H["Maintainer: merge develop into main --ff-only"]
    H --> I["Maintainer: Create Signed Tag: git tag -s vX.Y.Z"]
    I --> J["Maintainer: Push main & tag to GitHub"]
    J --> K[GitHub Actions Release Workflow]
    K --> L["Fail-Fast: Validate docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md exists"]
    K --> M[Build 6x Cross-Platform Binaries]
    K --> N[Package Starter Pack Archives]
    K --> O[Generate Checksums & Formula/okf.rb]
    K --> P[Publish GitHub Release]
    K --> Q[Auto-update okf-memory/homebrew-tap]
    K --> R[Auto-update okf-memory.github.io]
```

## 2. Master File Inventory for Releases

Whenever a new release is prepared, verify and update the following files:

| File Path | Requirement | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`docs/releases/v<X.Y.Z>.md`** | **MANDATORY (CI Gate)** | Release notes with highlights, detailed changes, community thanks, and mandatory `### Full Changelog` link. CI will fail-fast if absent! |
| **`docs/releases/README.md`** | **MANDATORY** | Release history table. Append new row with version, date, and 1-line summary. |
| **`knowledge/log.md`** | **MANDATORY** | Append dated entry `## YYYY-MM-DD` recording the release and any concept updates. |
| **`knowledge/roadmap/milestones.md`** | **MANDATORY** | Update phase count and ensure the completed phase row accurately reflects deliverables. |
| **`CONTRIBUTORS.md`** | **MANDATORY** | Credit all users who contributed code, bug reports, issue reproductions, or architectural feedback. Never credit the project's own agent or bot accounts. Reporters whose operator is unknown are thanked in the release notes; adding them here is at the maintainer's discretion. |
| **`docs/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`** | Optional | Update if security audit protocols, Jules templates, or invariants changed. |
| **`README.md`** | Optional | Update if release archive links, version badges, or CLI examples need alignment. |

## 3. Pre-Release Quality Gates

Run these commands locally before tagging to ensure 100% clean state:

```bash
# 1. Format code
make fmt

# 2. Synchronize active skills to embedded bootstrap assets
make sync-assets

# 3. Run complete verification pipeline (vet, lint, unit & integration tests, strict OKF bundle checks)
make check

# 4. Strict OKF knowledge validation with drift detection
./bin/okf validate knowledge --strict --drift

# 5. Verify git working directory is clean
git status
```

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Release Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Maintainer executes all commits, merges, tags, and pushes.** AI agents only stage the changes and propose the commit message. They never run `git commit`, `git merge`, `git tag`, or `git push`, and never disable or bypass the terminal sandbox to do so. Every command in the steps below that writes Git metadata is run by the maintainer, so commits and tags carry the maintainer's signature.

### Step 1: Author Release Notes & Update Files (on `develop`)

Always author release materials on **`develop`** first (an agent stops after `git add`):

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 1. Author docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md (use template below)
# 2. Update docs/releases/README.md
# 3. Update knowledge/log.md and knowledge/roadmap/milestones.md
# 4. Update CONTRIBUTORS.md

# Validate knowledge bundle
make validate

# Stage release documentation (agent or maintainer)
git add docs/releases/ docs/releases/README.md knowledge/ CONTRIBUTORS.md

# Maintainer only: signed commit and push
git commit -S -m "chore(release): prepare release notes and changelog for vX.Y.Z"
git push origin develop
```

### Step 2: Merge into `main` and Create Signed Tag (maintainer only)

```bash
# Switch to main and fast-forward
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --ff-only develop
git push origin main

# Create cryptographically signed tag
git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z: <Short Title>"

# Push tag to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always use `git tag -s` (or `git tag -a`) to sign the release tag with your GPG/SSH key. Unsigned lightweight tags should not be used for production releases.

## 5. Standard Release Notes Template

Save as `docs/releases/v<X.Y.Z>.md`:

```markdown
# Release v<X.Y.Z> – <Release Title>

<1-2 paragraph executive summary explaining the primary focus, key improvements, and user impact of this release.>

---

### 1. <Major Feature / Focus Area 1>
* **<Component>:** <Details of change, issue reference e.g. (#123)>.
* **<Impact>:** <What this unlocks for users/agents>.

### 2. <Major Feature / Focus Area 2>
* **<Component>:** <Details of change>.

### 3. Storage & Conformance Hardening
* **<Atomic Operations / Validation>:** <Details>.

### 4. Developer Experience & CI
* **<Testing / Tooling>:** <Details>.

### 5. Community & Special Thanks
* A huge thank you to <contributor> ([@handle](https://github.com/handle)) for <concrete contribution, reproduction, or PR> (#<issue>).

### 6. Pre-built Binaries
Standalone binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are available from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/okf-memory/okf-agent-memory/releases).

### 7. Full Changelog
See commits between `v<PREV_VER>...v<X.Y.Z>` on [GitHub](https://github.com/okf-memory/okf-agent-memory/compare/v<PREV_VER>...v<X.Y.Z>).
```

## 6. Pre-Release Checklist (Copy-Pasteable)

## 7. Post-Release Verification & Distribution Checks

After pushing the tag, verify all automated distribution channels:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Check `https://github.com/okf-memory/okf-agent-memory/actions`
   - Confirm all steps in `.github/workflows/release.yml` succeed.

2. **GitHub Release Assets:**
   - Confirm assets on `https://github.com/okf-memory/okf-agent-memory/releases/tag/v<X.Y.Z>`:
     - `okf-darwin-arm64`, `okf-darwin-amd64`
     - `okf-linux-arm64`, `okf-linux-amd64`
     - `okf-windows-arm64.exe`, `okf-windows-amd64.exe`
     - `okf-starter-pack-v<X.Y.Z>.tar.gz` & `.zip`
     - `checksums.txt`
     - `Formula/okf.rb`

3. **Homebrew Tap:**
   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade okf
   okf version
   ```

4. **Direct Go Install:**
   ```bash
   go install github.com/okf-memory/okf-agent-memory/cmd/okf@v<X.Y.Z>
   okf version
   ```

---

## 8. Hotfix Protocol

If an urgent regression is discovered in production:

1. **Branch off `main`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/vX.Y.Z main
   ```
2. **Implement fix & regression test** in `pkg/okf/`.
3. **Run quality gates**: `make check`.
4. **Follow the checklist**: Author `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` with hotfix notes.
5. **Merge to `main`**, tag with signed tag `git tag -s vX.Y.Z`, and push.
6. **Backport to `develop`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge main
   git push origin develop
   ```
