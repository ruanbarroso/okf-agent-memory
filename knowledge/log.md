## 2026-10-04
* **Update**: `convention/release-procedure.md` now reserves signed commits, merges, tags, and pushes for the maintainer; agents only stage changes and propose the commit message and must not disable the sandbox. Aligned `docs/project/playbooks/RELEASE_PLAYBOOK.md`.
* **Update**: `convention/dual-memory-architecture.md` states the enforced 400-token cap (`AAG-005`) for the managed block instead of the unenforced 100-150 token target. Aligned the AAG and DMAA RFCs and the README.
* **Update**: `okf agents lint` and `okf validate --agents` report total file tokens (`token_stats.total_tokens`) alongside managed block tokens; the budget still gates only the block.
* **Update**: Documented the human verification provenance guard in `architecture/security-boundaries.md`: non-human actors cannot add human `verified` entries, and the guard and the `verified.by=human` filter share one definition of a human identity.
* **Release**: Published version v0.6.0: symlinked bundle roots load correctly and stay confined (#45), custom list frontmatter fields stay typed lists across `okf update` (#49), `--filter` matches list-valued custom fields (#48), and `--filter` keys are exactly the frontmatter field names (breaking: removed the `tag`, `code_ref`, and `desc` aliases), plus a human verification provenance guard and detection of quoted frontmatter keys smuggled in a body.
* **Update**: Clarified the credit rule in `convention/release-procedure.md` and `convention/command-mutation-checklist.md`: never credit the project's own agent or bot accounts, credit external reporters and contributors by handle whether or not an agent files their report.
* **Update**: Updated concept `architecture/metadata-roundtrip.md`.
* **Update**: Updated concept `architecture/security-boundaries.md`.
