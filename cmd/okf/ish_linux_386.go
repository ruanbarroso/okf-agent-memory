// linux/386 exists for iSH (Alpine x86 emulated on iOS). Its emulator corrupts
// Go's state when signal-based async preemption fires or when several threads
// run Go code at once: TLS verification fails with "unknown authority" and the
// runtime dies with "morestack on g0" or random SIGSEGVs. Measured on an
// iPhone: a JSON/fmt stress test crashed every run with 4 Ps and passed every
// run with GOMAXPROCS=1 + GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1. That still crashed about
// once every few minutes, during garbage collection running alongside the
// program; with gcstoptheworld=1 (and GOGC=400, fewer collections) it stopped
// crashing in the same test.
//
// The crashes that remained (SIGSEGV on addresses made of response text, like
// 0x323b323b = ";2;2") come from iSH's madvise: it is a no-op that returns 0.
// Go on Linux defaults to madvdontneed=1 and then trusts that pages it gave
// back come back zeroed, so it skips clearing them; on iSH they still hold old
// data and a fresh object starts with stale pointers. madvdontneed=0 makes Go
// zero those pages itself.
//
// These settings are only read at process start, so the binary re-executes
// itself once with them in the environment. GOMAXPROCS/GOGC the user already
// set are kept; the marker variable stops a second re-exec.
